# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Versioning note:** versions use the four-part `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BUILD` form that KSP/Unity DLLs expect. The first three parts follow SemVer; the fourth part (`BUILD`) is repurposed here to mark pre-release / beta iterations of an upcoming version.

## v2.5.1 - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- In-game recordings no longer crush dark scenes or oversaturate colors on Windows, which was most visible as the sky darkens during ascent. Videos are now saved in the standard HD color format (BT.709, TV range) and say so in the file, so players, editors and OBS show them as they looked in game
- In-game recordings on Linux and macOS use the same standard HD colors, fixing slightly shifted hues
- In-game recording on Windows no longer fails to start when JRTI cannot use the graphics card for color conversion


## v2.5.0 - 2026-09-29

### Added

- Features from v2.4.1.1, v2.4.1.2 and v2.4.1.3 deemed stable, and now added to stable version
- For a full changelog, see below (version 2.4.1.1 to 2.4.1.3)


## v2.4.1.3 - 2026-09-27

### Added

- Columns option on the layout page (L) - keep cameras side by side (or stacked) instead of letting the page pick, for example two cameras side by side on a smaller screen


## v2.4.1.2 - 2026-09-27

### Added

- Saved layouts - save a layout under a name from the layout page's menu and open it anywhere with `layout.html?layout=Name`. Every screen showing it, OBS included, follows changes made from another device
- Clean feed for OBS (`layout.html?program`) - one browser source that shows the layout currently on air, with no controls. Switch with Take on air or Shift+1 to 9, and cameras glide into place. Stream Deck buttons can switch it through `/program/take/<layout name>`
- Camera list on the layout page (C) - click a camera to add it, or drag it onto a tile. Tiles can be dragged onto each other to swap them
- Undo on the layout page - an Undo button after removing or swapping tiles, and Ctrl+Z for any change
- Recordings panel - lists recordings saved on the KSP computer, with Play and Download from any device on the network
- Record, pause and stop from the camera viewer (Watch), not only from the main page
- The web UI shows the address other devices on your network can open

### Changed

- New web UI look: overall more readable style with a bundled font, words instead of icons, and color only for recording, paused and watched
- The web UI no longer loads anything from the internet, so it works on a LAN without internet access
- The camera viewer shows the camera's name and recording state, and reconnects on its own
- Spotlight sizes the small tiles to match the big one, and they no longer jump to the bottom in fullscreen
- Settings are saved in `PluginData/settings.cfg` so updates no longer reset them. Your current settings move there automatically (CKAN users may need to set them once more)
- Performance overlay moved to Ctrl+Alt+F6 (Ctrl+Alt+F7 also opened the main window)

### Fixed

- The Record button no longer stays disabled in browsers that cannot record on their own
- Camera cards no longer request snapshots while the page is in a background tab
- Card order and record groups are kept after a game restart


## v2.4.1.1 - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Performance overlay (Ctrl+Alt+F7 in flight, or Settings > Diagnostics) - game FPS and frame time, JRTI's own cost per frame, memory and garbage collections, plus per-camera render and stream stats. Can log to CSV (`PluginData/PerfLogs/`), and the latest sample is served as JSON at `/debug/stats`
- Diagnostics page in the web UI (gauge button, or `/debug.html`) - the same numbers live, with the last two minutes charted and values needing attention highlighted
- "Spread camera renders across frames" setting (on by default) - cameras take turns rendering instead of all on the same frame, evening out frame times with several cameras open or streaming
- Camera layout page in the web UI (grid button, or `/layout.html`) - watch several cameras in one window, with Spotlight (one large tile), Fullscreen and Fill (edge to edge split screens). Layouts are saved by camera name and can be shared as a link (`layout.html?cams=10,11,12`), handy as a single OBS browser source
- All cameras of a layout stream over one connection (`/streams?ids=1,2,3`), so large layouts no longer hit the browser's limit of 6 connections per host
- In-game recording, now the default - the Record button records an MP4 inside the game with the graphics card's encoder (Media Foundation on Windows, ffmpeg on Linux and macOS). Steady frame rate, keeps recording when the web page is closed, stays playable if the game crashes and scrubs cleanly in every player
- "Video codec" option in the web UI's recorder settings - H.264 stays the default, AV1 is available on Linux and macOS when ffmpeg has an AV1 encoder (not on Windows yet). See the README's "Recording & Codecs" section
- The browser recorder stays as a fallback when in-game recording can't start, and can still be picked in "Record with" (for example to save to another device). In-game recording can be turned off in the settings window

### Changed

- Every camera now renders at most Max FPS times per second, whether it has an in-game window, a stream, or both, instead of every (other) game frame. Streamed cameras only render when the stream needs a new frame. Camera windows used to render at half the game's frame rate (72 FPS on a 144 FPS game), so this is much lighter at high frame rates. Max FPS is now correctly labeled "camera windows and streams" since it applies to both respectively.
- Much less memory churn while streaming, which should reduce stutter. Each camera reuses its frame buffers instead of allocating a new one per frame (about 2.7 MB per frame at 720p), and per-render camera lookups no longer allocate
- At most two frames per camera are read back and encoded at once, so JPEG encoding can no longer pile up behind a slow CPU, while a slow readback or encode no longer lowers the stream's frame rate
- OpenGL (no async readback) no longer uploads every captured frame back to the GPU
- Stream captures now land on the game frame closest to when they are due instead of the first frame after, so a stream's frame spacing stays even when the game runs at about a multiple of Max FPS
- The main page's live card previews (shown for cameras someone is watching) now share one connection instead of opening one each, so the main page open next to a layout page or several viewers no longer runs into the browser's limit of 6 (or whatever the browser limits it to) connections per host

### Deprecated

- The browser recorder (MediaRecorder in the web page, uploaded in chunks) is now the legacy recorder, shown as "legacy" in the web UI. It will be removed in v3.0.0 along with its upload endpoints and the MP4/WebM fixers, as the in-game recorder is a much better solution and is much easier to maintain and debug.

### Removed

- Render camera windows every other frame setting has been replaced by the Max FPS setting which applies to both camera windows in game and in the streamer Web UI.

### Fixed

- When the web UI's port is taken by another program, JRTI now says so on screen and in the settings window next to the Port field, instead of only writing it to KSP.log.
- Streamed cameras now **properly** pace their frames attempting to hover towards the "Max framerate" option when being watched, which makes the viewing experience a lot smoother.
- Camera feeds recover on their own after closing the map view. Opening the map switches KSP's cameras and visual mods like Scatterer and EVE to map mode, and JRTI cameras kept the broken rendering until they were closed and reopened. They are now rebuilt half a second after the map closes, without interrupting streams, viewers or recordings (may cause a very brief freeze or lag spike to cameras that are rendering)
- Recordings no longer get stuck on "Saving..." or keep showing as recording after the game has already saved them. When the server closes a recording on its own (no data for 30 seconds), the web UI now notices and returns to idle instead of sending requests that keep failing, and saving gives up waiting after 15 seconds and leaves the file to the server
- Recording heartbeats now use their own endpoint and no longer pile up while the connection is slow
- A recording's camera stream now reconnects on its own when it ends (for example when the camera is closed and reopened in game), so a recording paused on signal loss records live frames again when it resumes instead of a frozen image


## v2.4.1 - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- Cameras sharing the same part (e.g. Starship Expansion Project's booster and ship parts) now work independently; opening or streaming one camera no longer marks every camera on that part as open/streaming. A custom ID set on such a part now numbers its cameras in order (ID 10 gives 10, 11, 12...), and a custom name is suffixed with each camera's own name (thanks to Recoleto for bringing this to my attention)
- The plugin DLL's assembly version now matches the release; it had been left at `2.3.0.0` since v2.3.0, so tools reading the DLL version reported the wrong release


## v2.4.0 - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Features from v2.3.0.1 deemed stable, and now added to stable version
- Merged PR#25 (restore OpenGL far-PQS camera rendering- #25); many thanks to ruedigerlenz for contributing!


## v2.3.0.1 - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **(Experimental)** Scatterer sun flare now renders through JRTI cameras - the per-camera sun flare hook is mirrored onto our cameras via reflection so the flare stops being culled on the JRTI feed. Requires Scatterer integration enabled. This beta is lightly tested - please report flares that fail to appear at some sun angles, look misplaced, or affect the main view

### Fixed

- Night-vision camera mode no longer brightens the main game view - the night-vision filter cloned onto JRTI cameras was forcing the scene-global ambient light high every frame, which bled onto the main camera; the boost is now confined to the JRTI camera's own render pass. Builds on andredichev's fix for the same issue


## v2.3.0 - 2026-05-30

### Added

- (Experimental) Option to disable the web streaming server entirely - run JRTI with in-game camera windows only, no HTTP server, browser streaming, or recording. Lighter on low-end machines. Toggle in Settings > Stream / Capture, or set `EnableStreamServer` in `settings.cfg`. Takes effect on next flight scene entry
- Per-camera brightness, contrast, and gamma controls in the web viewer - adjustments are applied server-side so all viewers on the local network see the same image
- Per-camera FOV control in the web viewer (shown when the camera reports a valid FOV range from KSP)

### Changed

- In-game UI polish pass - more spacious layouts, larger text, roomier buttons and camera controls

### Fixed

- Camera IDs are now scoped to a flight session and freed when a craft is recovered or unloaded - relaunching a craft reliably restores its chosen IDs instead of them being bumped because a now-gone craft still held the number
- The web server no longer reaches into live in-game camera state from its request threads, removing a rare race that could surface as a crash near the web UI
- Two memory structures (the runtime camera-ID map and the finalized-recording set) no longer grow unbounded over a long session
- Camera windows now cascade on screen when opened instead of all stacking in the bottom-right corner
- Camera windows now open in full UI mode by default - minimal mode (preview only) can be enabled in settings or toggled per-window with a double-click
- Double-clicking the camera preview to toggle minimal mode now correctly resizes the window immediately (used to bug out and not properly resize until the next manual resize from the user)


## v2.2.0.1 - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Cameras can now be named & given a unique ID via the right-click part menu in the VAB - stored in the craft file, no external config needed

### Fixed

- Opening more than 4 viewer tabs no longer stalls - the status poll in the viewer now only starts after signal loss, eliminating the persistent per-tab connection that was saturating the browser's HTTP/1.1 connection pool
- WebM VINT encoding bitwise-or on sign-extended operand


## v2.2.0 - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- Settings menu now auto-saves instead of requiring the user to click "Save" (which is now removed), and applies changes immediately without needing to close the menu
- Cleaned up disposition of Web UI

### Added

- Setting to ignore FOV limits from hullcamera
- Docking camera overlay with telemetry (credits to andredichev for the PR)
- A new parameter `FixedPreviewAspectRatio` (boolean) to `settings.cfg`, allowing the in-game camera preview to be forced to a 1:1 aspect ratio (thanks to andredichev for the PR again)
- Mod version label in settings menu
- Minimal UI option in settings
- Fixed preview aspect ratio when `FixedPreviewAspectRatio` is enabled, so it doesn't stretch to fit the container (user setting, thanks to andredichev for the PR, once more :D)
- Added recording groups to allow recording a select subset of cameras within a group

### Fixed

- Drag the in-game preview by the camera image (on large screens, it can be difficult to target the title bar with the mouse... courtesy of andredichev)
- More space for the streaming label (suggestions from KSP forums && changes by andredichev)
- Mac camera streaming now works via a synchronous GPU readback fallback (Metal does not support Unity's async readback API)


## v2.1.0 - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Draggable camera cards instead of static, "randomly" (not really :p) ordered camera cards
- New "render every other frame" setting exposed, allowing rendering every frame (with warning about performance)

### Changed

- We now show live feed when camera is already being watched (costs no performance and nice to have)
- The camera status ("Idle" label, by default) clearer, i.e : when a camera being watched
- The two notes above close issue #13 proposing nice QoL changes
- Refactored the camera streaming JavaScript code (no functionality change)
- We now take a snapshot whenever camera goes to an inactive state from an active one doesn't watse ressources since it was active up until that point, smoothly allows to transition between active and inactive view
- Fix customlos.png not found (error 404) in some instances, where the code would mistakenly interpret is as always present when it's only conditionally there
- Watch button now still usable after camera disconnects (in cases where signal may come back)
- Bumped up default settings (performance improvements since v1.0.0 allows for that!!)
- Use Hullcam's FoV instead of our "own" FoV (still allow to modify it with the slider, but by default match Hullcam's if it's applicable)

### Fixed

- Anti-Aliasing minimum option from 1 to 0 (so it's clearer 0 means NO AA)
- Mobile experience should feel a lot better with the new responsive layout and touch-friendly controls


## v2.0.1 - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- "Stop" button now properly turns green if a client is requesting the camera feed


## v2.0.0 Web UI Recording, Polishing, QoL and more! - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Recording is now available in this new version
- Unified **Settings & Integrations** menu merging the former Settings and Debug menus into a single scrollable window with four collapsible sections: Stream/Capture, Visual Mod Integrations, Diagnostics, and Troubleshooting
- Visual mod integrations (Deferred, TUFX, Scatterer, EVE, Parallax, Firefly) are now toggleable directly from the unified menu with live availability indicators
- **HullcamVDS Camera Filter** integration - discovers the active Hullcam filter/overlay material at runtime via reflection and blits it over the stream frame; falls back silently to raw frame when unavailable or unset
- Integration enable/disable state now persists to `settings.cfg` and is restored on launch (previously runtime-only)
- Stream All button on in-game Flight UI - streams all available cameras in one click (shown only when more than one camera is available)
- Settings button on in-game Flight UI - opens the unified settings menu directly from the flight toolbar window
- Custom LOS screen support (drop `customlos.png` alongside `los.png` to override)
- `GET /session` endpoint returning a per-launch UUID, used by the web client to detect a fresh game session
- Troubleshooting section in the unified menu documenting when a camera or feed reload is needed, with a one-click "Reload Integrations" button

### Fixed

- Persisted offline/destroyed camera cards from a previous game launch are now cleared on page load when a new game session is detected - the web client compares the stored session UUID against the server's and wipes `localStorage` on mismatch
- Firefox integration now properly allows recording (however, not constantly reliable, see known issues)

### Changed

- Integration enable flags moved from `JRTIDebugMenu` (runtime-only statics) to `JRTISettings` (persisted properties)  **Parallax still defaults to `false`**
- `JRTIDebugMenu` removed; all functionality absorbed into the unified `JRTISettingsGUI`
- Ctrl+Alt+F8 (former debug menu) and Ctrl+Alt+F9 (former settings) now both open the same unified menu

### Known Issues

- Firefox recording output is unreliable - the recorded file may be corrupt or unplayable
- Stale zero-byte buffer files are sometimes left in the recordings folder after a recording session ends
- macOS is not properly supported - a GPU async API used by this Unity version is unavailable on macOS (legacy KSP/Unity quirk); a fix is being investigated
- Performance degradation with Parallax enabled - Parallax integration is disabled by default for this reason


## v2.0.0-beta.4 Web UI Recording (Beta 4) - 2026-04-17

There is nothing permanent except change

### Added

- Server-side SIDX (segment index) injection on MP4 finalize, enabling frame-accurate scrubbing and seeking in all recorded files without any post-processing step

### Fixed

- Pause/Resume button on recording cards stayed visible when idle - `.btn` uses `display: inline-flex`, which overrode the HTML `hidden` attribute (whose default is `display: none`). Added a single `[hidden] { display: none !important; }` rule so the attribute works as expected everywhere it's used
- Camera-card footer size label now reads `LAST RECORDING SIZE = X MB` instead of a bare byte count, and persists after the recording ends instead of clearing the moment the state flips to idle
- Accidentally hardcoded WebM as mimeType instead of accepting whichever other flag was available in the candidate list, which caused recording to fail on certain occasions
- MP4 recordings were never seekable  `FixMp4` was silently crashing on every finalize due to a 4-byte header miscalculation in the SIDX builder (`28` → `32`), causing an `IndexOutOfRangeException` that was swallowed by the outer catch
- Offline camera cards disappeared on page refresh - `localStorage` was overwritten with only the live camera list on each sync, immediately evicting any card that had just gone offline. Persistence now snapshots all cards after each sync loop completes

### Changed

- `camera-card.js` refactor for readability (no behaviour change): state-dependent UI mutations now driven by a `REC_STATES` lookup table instead of a four-branch `if/else`, DOM construction split across `_buildPreview` / `_buildInfo` / `_buildFooter`, and the three near-identical copy-button blocks replaced by `makeButton` / `makeCopyButton` helpers
- The disabled-when-unsupported record button now uses a `.btn-unsupported` CSS class instead of inline `opacity` / `pointerEvents` styles, to match the existing `.btn.watch-disabled` pattern
- Removed WebM support due to inconsistent browser support. The list of MIME types is now just MP4 variants, which should be supported widely enough for the time being
- `JRTIStreamServer` split into partial class files by concern (`Http`, `Recording`, `Mp4`, `Types`) to reduce the size of the monolith
- `FixMp4` is now self-contained - wrapped in its own try-catch that logs full exceptions with stack trace and never propagates to `FinalizeRecordingSession`

### Known Issues

- Faint reflection/shadow artifact visible on Kerbin and the Mun through JRTI cameras when Scatterer and/or EVE are installed. Actual shadows render correctly, so this looks like a hook or reflection probe tied to the main camera's frustum bleeding into the mod camera. Under investigation
- Sometimes, there will be MP4 files with a size of 0 bytes that do not get cleaned up in the recordings folder. This problem is being investigated.


## v2.0.0-beta.3 Web UI Recording (Beta 3) - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Manual pause/resume button on recording cards
- Loss-of-signal triggered pause now waits 5 s before acting - the recording is allowed to capture the LOS screen during that window

### Fixed

- Grid layout broken after live/offline section split - `#cameras` rule was orphaned; replaced with rules targeting `#cameras-live` and `#cameras-offline`
- Recording cards no longer show a double preview: the recorder canvas is now absolutely positioned and the offline overlay is explicitly hidden on mount
- Snapshot loop no longer fires immediately on every card at once after the jitter refactor; first fetch is immediate, jitter only offsets the interval start

### Changed

- LOS signal to the recorder is decoupled from the visual offline state - the recorder has its own 5 s delay independent of the overlay delay
- Paused status text no longer reads "signal lost", since pause is now also user-triggered


## v2.0.0-beta.2 Web UI Recording (Beta 2) - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Remote viewers (non-localhost) get a local Save-As dialog instead of uploading to the KSP machine
- "Copy URL" copies the viewer page link; new "Copy Raw" button copies the bare MJPEG feed URL for OBS and other external tools (with a hover tooltip)

### Fixed

- Removed `video/x-matroska;codecs=avc1` from the MIME candidate list - it is unsupported by all major browsers and was masking the correct VP9 WebM fallback on Linux
- Cameras no longer render when nobody is watching - the lazy rendering guard is now applied before `SetCamerasEnabled`, not after. Previously the GPU rendered every frame regardless of active clients
- Snapshot polling interval raised to 10 s (was 2 s) and snapshot interest window reduced to 3 s, so cameras sleep between polls rather than staying hot continuously
- Heartbeat and server-side session management are now skipped entirely for remote (local-save) recordings


## v2.0.0-beta.1 Web UI Recording (Beta 1) - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Basic recording support in the web UI (experimental)
- Recording support in the C# API


## v1.0.0 - 2026-04-15

### Added

- Initial public release
